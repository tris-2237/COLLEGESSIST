For generations, the University of Mannheim has been preparing students to take on leadership roles in business, academia, and society. One of the university's strengths in this task is its profile, which is characterised by the economic and social sciences. It is in these fields that the University of Mannheim has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top 20 European research institutions. 
The campus surrounding Mannheim's baroque palace is a place where bright minds from across the globe come together to learn, discuss, research, and prepare to make their mark on the world. Every fifth student at the university comes from abroad to pursue their bachelor's or master's degree, or doctorate in Mannheim. Students of the Mannheim Business School also come from overseas to obtain a management qualification at one of the MBA providers in the world business administration.
