The University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in Oakland before moving to Berkeley in 1873. Overtime, several branches and satellite programs were established. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus in Berkeley, with Robert Gordon Sproul remaining in place as President, but Clark Kerr becoming the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley,and Raymond B. Allen becoming the first Chancellor of UCLA.[12] However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies,[13] and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as President that UC was able to evolve into a system from 1957 to 1960.[14] At that time, chancellors were appointed for more campuses and each was granted some degree of greater autonomy.
The University of California currently has 10 campuses, a combined student body of 285,216 students, 22,700 faculty members, 154,900 staff members and over 2.0 million living alumni.[2] Its newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005. Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students; one campus, UC San Francisco, enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences. In addition, the UC Hastings College of Law, located in San Francisco, is legally affiliated with UC, but other than sharing its name is entirely autonomous from the rest of the system. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also includes the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System. It is governed by a semi-autonomous Board of Regents.
